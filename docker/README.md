These docker files provided a basis for dockerized versions of the application components. They were added to the Docker Hub with automatic building:

- [iotitude/baasbox](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotitude/baasbox/)
- [iotitude/baasbox-data](https://hub.docker.com/r/iotitude/baasbox-data/)

BaasBox was setup on Rancher with the commands of the docker-compose.yml file.
